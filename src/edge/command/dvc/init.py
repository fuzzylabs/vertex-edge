Now you can version your data using DVC. See https://dvc.org/doc for more details about how it can be used. 

What's next? We suggest you proceed with:

  Train and deploy a model (see 'Training a model' section of the README for more details):
    ./edge.sh model init fashion
    dvc repro {get_model_dvc_pipeline("fashion")}
    ./edge.sh model deploy fashion
