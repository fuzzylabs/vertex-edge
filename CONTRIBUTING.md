## How can I contribute?

### Testing

This is a new project that is moving fast, and so one of the most useful ways you can help out is simply testing the tools and the documentation in order to tease out bugs, edge-cases and opportunities to improve things.

If you are testing this out, whether in production or not, we're really keen to hear from you and to receive your feedback.

### Reporting bugs

Sadly, bugs happen; we're sorry! Before reporting a bug, please check the [open issues](/fuzzylabs/vertex-edge/issues) to see if somebody has submitted the same bug before. If so, feel free to add further detail to the existing issue.

If your bug hasn't been raised before then [go ahead and raise it](fuzzylabs/vertex-edge/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) using our bug report template. Please provide as much information as possible to help us to reproduce the bug.

### Suggesting enhancements

Enhancements and feature requests are very much welcome. We hope to learn from real-world useage which features are missing so that we can improve the tool to meet the expectations of real machine learning projects. Please use our [feature request template](fuzzylabs/vertex-edge/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=) to do this.
